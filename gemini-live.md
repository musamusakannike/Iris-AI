# Gemini Live API overview

The Live API enables low-latency, real-time voice and vision interactions with
Gemini. It processes continuous streams of audio, images, and text to deliver
immediate, human-like spoken responses, creating a natural conversational
experience for your users.

## Use cases  {% id="use-cases" %}

Live API can be used to build real-time voice agents for a
variety of industries, including:

*   **E-commerce and retail:** Shopping assistants that offer personalized
  recommendations and support agents that resolve customer issues.

*   **Gaming:** Interactive non-player characters (NPCs), in-game help
  assistants, and real-time translation of in-game content.

*   **Next-gen interfaces:** Voice- and video-enabled experiences in robotics,
  smart glasses, and vehicles.

*   **Healthcare:** Health companions for patient support and education.

*   **Financial services:** AI advisors for wealth management and investment
  guidance.

*   **Education:** AI mentors and learner companions that provide personalized
  instruction and feedback.

*   **Translation and localization:** Real-time, low-latency translation of
  spoken conversations, enabling seamless multilingual communication.

*   **Live transcription and captioning:** Real-time speech-to-text streaming for
  live subtitles, meeting transcription, voice dictation, and customer call logging.

## Choose an implementation approach  {% id="implementation-approach" %}

When integrating with Live API, you'll need to choose one of the following
implementation approaches:

-   **Server-to-server**: Your backend connects to the Live API using
  [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). Typically, your client sends stream data (audio, video,
  text) to your server, which then forwards it to the Live API.

-   **Client-to-server**: Your frontend code connects directly to the Live API
  using [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to stream data, bypassing your backend.


{% callout type="note" %}
  Note: Client-to-server generally offers better performance for streaming audio
  and video, since it bypasses the need to send the stream to your backend first.
  It's also easier to set up since you don't need to implement a proxy that sends
  data from your client to your server and then your server to the API. However,
  for production environments, in order to mitigate security risks, we recommend
  using [ephemeral tokens](/docs/live-api/ephemeral-tokens) instead of standard
  API keys.
